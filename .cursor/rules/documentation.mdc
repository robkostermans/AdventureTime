# AdventureTime Documentation Rules

## Feature Documentation Requirement

When implementing any new feature or modifying existing functionality in AdventureTime:

1. **Always update the specs** - Every feature change must be documented in the appropriate `specs/*.md` file
2. **Create new spec files when needed** - If a feature doesn't fit existing spec documents, create a new `specs/<feature-name>.md` file
3. **Update the index** - If creating a new spec file, add it to `specs/index.md` in the Architecture Specifications table

## Spec File Structure

Each spec document should include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Configuration options (if any)
- Technical implementation details
- Visual diagrams where helpful (ASCII art)
- Code examples showing usage

## Existing Spec Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app-concept.md` | Core game concept, mechanics, avatar, world system |
| `project-structure.md` | File and folder organization |
| `build-system.md` | TypeScript compilation and Vite bundling |
| `module-system.md` | Feature organization and imports |
| `entry-point.md` | Main initialization and IIFE setup |
| `feature-architecture.md` | Individual feature structure patterns |
| `bookmarklet-integration.md` | Bookmarklet-specific considerations |

## When to Update vs Create New

**Update existing spec** when:
- Adding to core game mechanics → `app-concept.md`
- Changing build configuration → `build-system.md`
- Modifying feature patterns → `feature-architecture.md`

**Create new spec** when:
- Adding a major standalone system (e.g., collision detection, inventory)
- The feature is complex enough to warrant its own document
- It doesn't logically fit in existing specs

## Example Workflow

1. Receive feature request
2. Identify which spec file(s) need updating
3. Implement the feature in code
4. Document the feature in specs with:
   - What it does
   - How to configure it
   - Technical details
5. Test the implementation
